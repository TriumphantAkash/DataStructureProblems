PERFORCE (P4V)
--------

- A revision control system, manages a central database and master repository
- CLIENT
	1) Get latest version in local repository
	2) Do changes
	3) checkin code along with a KONA ID (a defect management system) and submit
		(KONA issue has to be in open state during checkin code to Perforce) 
	4) file version (3/4) means
		you have 3rd version
		total versions are 4

So, each person works on defferent branches and this is how perforce manges different revisions



hands on experience on follwing source code quality checking tools : (try to find out the potential bugs and make code more sophisticated)
------------------------------------------------------------------
- ProtexIP/blackduck (used for open source analysis, code does not hava a plagiarized code, violations etc.)
- prevent/Coverty (to check potential bugs, memory corruption (using strcpy instead of strncpy), NULL pointer exceptions etc.)
- Checkpatch before releasing any patch
- 

MATLAB (MATrix Laboratory)
--------------------------
- A numerical computing environment and programming language
- allows
	matrix manipulation
	plotting of function and data
	implementation of algorithms
	creation of user interface
	interfacing with programs written in other language
